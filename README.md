## Matt's Cloud Journey

### About me
CTO of [GigaTECH LLC](https://gigatech.net/). You can find us on [Github](https://github.com/GigaTech-net). Are you interested in joining us? See our [challenges](https://github.com/GigaTech-net/best-practices#join-us) and [openings](https://gigatech.net/job-openings/).

I love dogs and train them in my spare time. Currently teaching a 9 month old Golden Retriever!
Hanging out on the water can't be beat. You can come see me at [Lake Anna in Central VA](https://lakeanna.guide/)!

### This Challenge

A couple months ago, I helped form a new IT services company specializing in helping the US Government and especially the VA! We love our veterans! Thanks for your service!

This company is young when it comes to tech infrastructure, processes and procedures. I am taking this challenge to bootstrap our technology offerings, automation and gain a better understanding of a wide range of cloud technologies and supporting technologies.

### What's at the end?

Certifications, maybe.  That may help win work. Where i'd really like to be is to have created an agile technology company that can pivot and shift as needed. To do this, we need a solid cloud infrastructure as well as great automation supporting our business and our clients! Delivering that in 100 days would be outstanding!
