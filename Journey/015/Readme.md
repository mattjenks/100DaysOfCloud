# Serverless tutorials

## Introduction

Trying to wrap my ahead around the various serverless options in AWS. Took this over a week.

## Prerequisite

- I want to understand the core serverless technologies in aws
  - api gateway (rest/graphql)
  - lambda
  - DynamoDB
  - amplify

## Cloud Research

- took this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-lambda-serverless-architecture)
- starting reading [this book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/full-stack-serverless/9781492059882/)

of key note...

- Using MFA with a role I had previously setup with terraform
- Using the serverless framework and their offline mode (docker)
- xcode would not behave (gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!) in some fo the amplify tutorials and this [post](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/gyp-no-xcode-or-clt-version-detected-macos-catalina-anansewaa-38b536389e8d) was extremely helpful.
